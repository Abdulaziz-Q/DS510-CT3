### CT3: Multiple Test Taking
The CT3 is about SAT scores. We asked to do the following:

The SAT is one of the exams that are used as an entrance criterion by many US universities. The Chronicle of Higher Education (2003, January 29) summarized an article on the American Prospect website entitled "College Try: Why Universities Should Avoid Allowing Applicants to Take the SATs Over and Over Again." This article argues that existing college admission policies encourage applicants to take the SAT exam several times and only use the highest score for admission cons Two alternatives are proposed by the author that he feels would be fairer than using the highest score. The following are:
- Alternative 1: Use the average of all test scores
- Alternative 2: Use only the most recent score 

In this activity, by looking at the sampling distributions of three figures for the cases of a test taker taking the exam twice and a test taker taking the exam five times, you can examine the discrepancies between the three possibilities:
- max = maximum score
- mean = average score
- recent = most recent score
